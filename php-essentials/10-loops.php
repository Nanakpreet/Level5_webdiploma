<?php
/* In this scenario, you are combining some of what you've learnt to create
a text filtering system to remove bad words from a product review page.

You are to use PHP to loop over the provided text
and replace any words that match those contained in the $filter array with a * character.

You may not change the $comment variable or $filter array directly,
and should define your own variables when manipulating text.

Use the internet to find help for any functions you don't understand.
*/

$comment = "I have recently purchased your product and have bad-words to say about it. You see I have tried its functionality and it does not meet the specifications expressed on the box. One star. Will not buy again.";

$filter = ["bad-words", "not"];

//1. Use the Explode function to separate the comment into an array of words
$filter_arr = [];
$comment_array  = explode(" ", $comment);

//2. Create an empty array variable that will have parsed words appended to it
$filter_array = [];
//3. Create a foreach loop to loop over each word in the comment words array

foreach($comment_array as $word){
    if(in_array($word, $filter))
    array_push($filter_array, "*");
    else{
        array_push($filter_array, $word);
    }
}
//4. Within the loop, use an if statement to check if the current word is in
//   the $filter array. If it is, array_push "*" to your empty array.
//   If it is not, simply push the word to the empty array.

$filtered_comment = implode(" ", $filter_array);

//5. Use the implode function to join your filtered comment array into a string


//6. Echo your filtered comment under the marked HTML below.

/*
Extras:
7. You can add extra words to the $filter array to have them removed from the comment.
8. Currently the if statement is case sensitive. If you add "you" to the filter,
    it will not be caught. Find a function that allows you to make the word variable
    lowercase within your in_array statement.
